        <h2>CALABARZON REPRESENTZ: ETIVAC</h2>
        <p>Cavite is a province in the CALABARZON region of Luzon, Philippines. It is known for hosting significant events during the Philippine Revolution against Spanish authority. The province is rich in cultural heritage, with numerous historical sites, including the Aguinaldo Shrine in Kawit, where Philippine independence was declared in 1898. Its proximity to Metro Manila makes it a popular destination for both historical tourists and residential purposes. Cavite's culture combines traditional Filipino values with a more contemporary global impact due to its developing infrastructure. The best time to visit Cavite is during the dry season, which runs from December to May, with cooler, more comfortable weather. The rainy season, from June to November, can bring heavy showers, limiting outdoor sightseeing. The primary language spoken in Cavite is Tagalog, which is also the official language of the Philippines, but Chabacano is also spoken. English is widely spoken in business and urban areas. The Philippine Peso (PHP) is the currency used in Cavite and throughout the Philippines, with most establishments accepting cash and ATMs in cities and major towns. Credit and debit cards are also accepted in developed towns. Mobile payment systems like GCash and PayMaya are also widely used.</p>
